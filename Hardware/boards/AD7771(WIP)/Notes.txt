AD7771 breakout board for general use. Some of the additional parts are purposefully scaled back a little bit for cost-effectiveness, from what was recommended in the docs.

.brd file incoming! Still validating the layout!

Modular design model:

Microcontroller module (rigid)
ADC module (rigid)
Sensor mount module (flexible)

This means the ADC and uC are reusable. We can design noise control indepedently to deal with low intensity signals (EEG/ELF), and have the essential components be individual and easier to propagate for more people to use for their own applications. Boom, progress. Open source fo lyfe


Notes on noise reduction options:
	Better LDO and VRef
	Digital Isolation (not always necessary)
	Bipolar supply
	4 layer board with better wiring
